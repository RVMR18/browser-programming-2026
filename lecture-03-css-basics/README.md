# Lecture 03 – CSS Basics

## What I implemented this lecture
- Linked external CSS file
- Applied basic typography and spacing
- Styled header, footer, and navigation
- Made images responsive
- Centered and constrained main content layout

## CSS selectors I used
- Element selector (body, h1, p)
- Group selector (header, footer)
- Descendant selector (nav a)
- Class selector (.card)
- ID selector (#works)
- Pseudo-class (a:hover)

## One thing I struggled with
- Choosing the correct CSS selectors to target elements without affecting others


## One improvement I want to do next
- Improve layout using Flexbox
