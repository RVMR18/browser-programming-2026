# Lecture 02 – Semantic HTML & Structure

## 1. What I implemented this lecture
- Structured the portfolio page using semantic HTML elements
- Added a portfolio section with images, links, and an embedded video
- Improved accessibility with alt text, skip link, and proper heading hierarchy

---

## 2. Semantic decisions I made (REQUIRED)

### Decision 1
- Element(s) used: `<header>`
- Where in the page: At the top of the page
- Why this element is semantically correct:
  The header contains introductory content such as my name and personal
  information, which represents the purpose of the page.

### Decision 2
- Element(s) used: `<section>` and `<article>`
- Where in the page: Portfolio and content sections
- Why this element is semantically correct:
  Sections group related thematic content, and the article element is used
  to represent a standalone project within the portfolio.

### Decision 3
- Element(s) used: `<figure>` and `<figcaption>`
- Where in the page: Around images and the embedded video
- Why this element is semantically correct:
  These elements associate media content with descriptive captions,
  improving structure and accessibility.

## 3. Accessibility considerations
- Added a skip link to allow keyboard users to jump directly to the main content
- Used correct heading hierarchy (h1 → h2 → h3)
- Added alt text for all images
- Used semantic HTML elements instead of generic divs

These features improve usability for screen readers and keyboard navigation.

## 4. What I learned
- How to structure a webpage using semantic HTML
- Why accessibility is important even without visual design
- How proper HTML structure improves readability and maintainability

---

## 5. What I still need to improve
- Writing more detailed alt text for complex images
- Structuring larger projects with multiple articles
- Testing accessibility using screen readers

---

## 6. Notes about AI usage (if any)
- Tool used: ChatGPT
- What I accepted as-is:
  General semantic structure and accessibility patterns
- What I modified manually:
  Personal information, project descriptions, and links
